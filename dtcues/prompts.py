"""Prompt bank.

Every prompt is a PromptSpec with factor tags so analysis can slice by factor.
Factors:
  question   - core question wording (carries lexical *register*: academic vs LW vs neutral)
  persona    - explicit self-identification sentence prepended (or none)
  stated_view- whether the user announces their own view (none / cdt / fdt)
  honesty    - whether an "answer with your own honest view" instruction is appended
  fmt        - 'pick' (single <theory> tag) or 'credence' (JSON credences)

Sets (see DESIGN.md):
  A register-only   B persona-only   C persona x register cross
  D stated view     E honesty instruction   F credence format
