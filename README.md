# Frontier models state different decision theory preferences depending on who's asking

Companion repository for the LessWrong post of that title (Alex Kastner, 2026):
**https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SPt3TjcxS8oxftTH6/frontier-models-state-different-decision-theory-preferences**

It holds everything behind the post's figures: the exact prompts, every raw sample from every model, the judge's
classification of each answer, and the code that turns them into the figures and tables.

## This fork: eating animals (set `AW`)

This fork reruns the post's main cues with the decision-theory question replaced by the PhilPapers 2020 survey question on
eating animals: "Is it permissible to eat animals and/or animal products in ordinary circumstances?", answered with
omnivorism, vegetarianism or veganism. The pilot asks DeepSeek V4.1 Flash, GLM 5.3 Flash and GPT-6 Luna 20 times per cue
through OpenRouter, and classifies the free-text answers with the post's rubric and Sonnet 5 judge. The results page is
published at **https://danwahl.github.io/aw-audience-cues/**.

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `dtcues/prompts.py` | Set `AW`: the question, plus the post's personas, openers, interest openers and conversations, except two that would leak into the answer (the opener citing Nozick, and the conversation in which the user says they eat mostly vegetarian). |
| `dtcues/providers.py` | `OpenRouter`, used for any model id containing a `/`. `judge_notags.py` reaches the judge through OpenRouter when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is unset. |
| `dtcues/animals_page.py` | Builds the results page from `animals_page_template.html`. `.github/workflows/pages.yml` runs it on every push to `main` that touches the code or the pilot data. |
| `data/raw_*_notags_aw.jsonl.gz` | The pilot's samples. Their labels are in `data/judge_notags.jsonl.gz` with the rest. |

```bash
uv run python -m dtcues run --models deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash --sets AW --n 20 --notags --concurrency 16 \
    --out results/raw_deepseek_deepseek-v4.1-flash_notags_aw.jsonl
uv run python -m dtcues.judge_notags
uv run python -m dtcues.animals_page   # -> post/animals/index.html
```

Some answers to the nurse and Anthropic-employee personas read the question as whether the asker's job allows eating
animals, which inflates omnivorism on those rows.

## What is here

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|

| `post/tables_generated_notags.md` | Every table the code can generate from the tag-free data, one section per table key (the post uses a trimmed selection). |
| `post/prompts_verbatim.md` | Every prompt behind the post's tables, verbatim. |
| `results/OTHER_MODELS.md` | The post's first table (one sentence about the user, then the question) and the concrete-problems table for every model tested. |
| `results/DEEP_PREFERENCE_OTHER_MODELS.md` | The "FDT/UDT preference runs deeper" tests (thinking effort, book praise at the highest effort, anti-tailoring system prompts, reasoning summaries) repeated on Opus 5.5, Opus 5 and GPT-6 Astra, with a reading. |
| `results/REASONING_OTHER_MODELS.md` | Reasoning summaries for every model (Fable 5.1, Fable 5, Opus 5.5, Opus 5, Sonnet 5, GPT-6 Astra), added 2026-10-02: how often summaries speak favourably of each theory, lean toward one theory before pivoting, mention the user, or cite an anti-tailoring instruction, by persona and system prompt; plus a recheck showing GPT-6 Astra's default-setting answers have changed since the post's September runs. Built by `dtcues/judge_cot.py` (judges) and `dtcues/cot_report.py`; verbatim samples in `results/reasoning_examples.md`. |

## Reproducing the tables

```bash
uv sync
uv run python scripts/pack_data.py unpack                           # data/*.jsonl.gz -> results/*.jsonl
POST_MODE=notags uv run python -m dtcues.post_tables --no-splice   # -> post/tables_generated_notags.md
POST_MODE=notags uv run python -m dtcues.other_models              # -> results/OTHER_MODELS.md
POST_MODEL=claude-opus-5-5 POST_MODE=notags uv run python -m dtcues.post_tables   # -> post/tables_generated_notags_claude-opus-5-5.md
uv run python -m dtcues.compare_models claude-opus-5-5 claude-opus-5             # -> results/MODEL_COMPARISON.md
uv run python -m dtcues.post_prompts                               # -> post/prompts_verbatim.md
uv run python -m dtcues.serve_report                               # preview of the post at http://localhost:8791/post.html
```

No API key is needed for any of that. To sample new answers, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, add keys, and run for example

```bash
uv run python -m dtcues run --models claude-fable-5-1 --effort high --n 100 --notags \
    --ids B__Q_neutral__acad_prof --concurrency 20 --out results/raw_claude-fable-5-1_high_notags_example.jsonl
uv run python -m dtcues.judge_notags        # classify every unjudged free-text answer with Claude Sonnet 5
```

`--topup-to 100` instead of `--n 100` adds samples until every prompt has 100 valid ones across all raw files.
To replicate the whole post on another model, `POST_MODE=notags uv run python -m dtcues.model_plan --model <id> --launch --chunks 12 --concurrency 100`
records every (prompt, effort) cell the table generators read and tops that model up in parallel processes; then run the judges
(`dtcues.judge_notags`, `dtcues.judge_fav <id>`, `dtcues.judge_thinking_notags <id>`) and build its tables with `POST_MODEL=<id>`.

## How the data was produced

**Prompts.** `dtcues/prompts.py` (`build_prompts()`) defines every prompt. Ids have the form `SET__QUESTION__CUE[__VARIANT]`,
for example `B__Q_neutral__acad_prof` is the fixed question preceded by "I'm a philosophy professor who works on decision theory."
The main sets: `A` no cue, `B`/`M`/`X` one-sentence personas, `S` system prompts, `U1`/`U6` earlier conversation turns
(answered live by the model), `AA` concrete decision problems and the acausal-trade questions with cues, `BB`
name-a-theory-then-face-a-problem, `AH` book praise, `WR` remediation system prompts, `V` other philosophical debates,
`BW` question wordings. `post/prompts_verbatim.md` lists the rendered text of everything the post uses.

**Tag-free answers.** The post's numbers come from prompts run with `--notags`, which strips every "put your answer in
`<theory></theory>` tags" instruction, so the model answers in free text as it would for a normal user. Each answer is
classified by Claude Sonnet 5 with the fixed rubrics in `dtcues/judge_notags.py` (which theory is named, which option
is chosen, yes/no, and so on); labels are cached in `judge_notags.jsonl`, keyed by a hash of the answer text.
Files without `notags` in the name are the earlier tagged runs (the model answers inside tags, parsed by
`dtcues/parse.py`); `results/NOTAGS_CHECK.md` compares the two per prompt.

**Sampling.** Claude models: Anthropic Messages API with adaptive thinking (summarized) and `output_config.effort`
set to low, high (the default and the setting for every table unless stated), xhigh or max. GPT-6 Astra: OpenAI
Responses API with default settings. Output cap 16,000 tokens for high effort (never reached), 128,000 for max effort.
Every percentage is computed over the first 100 valid samples per prompt (by timestamp), excluding API errors and
answers cut off by the output cap; `rows()` in `dtcues/post_tables.py` implements this.

**Reasoning summaries.** `thinking` holds the summarized reasoning the API returns (raw chains of thought are not
available); `dtcues/judge_thinking.py` and `dtcues/judge_fav.py` annotate them.

## Row format

One JSON object per line. The fields that matter:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `prompt_id`, `set`, `persona`, `question`, `fmt`, `system`, `prefix`, `prior_turns`, `followups` | Which prompt (see `dtcues/prompts.py`). |
| `prompt_text` | The exact final user turn sent. `prior_responses` holds the model's live replies to any earlier turns. |
| `model`, `served_model`, `effort`, `sample_idx`, `ts`, `request_id` | Model id as requested and as served, thinking effort, sample index, Unix timestamp. |
| `response_text`, `thinking`, `stop_reason`, `usage` | The answer, its reasoning summary, why generation stopped, token counts. |
| `fu_records` | For two-turn prompts: the follow-up turn(s) and their answers. |
| `notags` | `true` for tag-free runs. |

The judge caches (`judge_notags.jsonl`, `judge_thinking*.jsonl`, `judge_fav.jsonl`) map a hash of the judged text to the label.

## Where each table in the post comes from

| Post section | Table key in `post/tables_generated_notags.md` |
|---|---|
| A sentence identifying the user as an academic | `personas` |
| Academic-philosophy-coded topics; question wording | `openers`, `tasks`, `wording` |
| Anti-sycophancy overcorrection | `views`, `ahmed` (and `results/AHMED_JOYCE.md`) |
| Concrete decision problems; acausal trade | `matrix`, `acausal` |
| Consistency after naming a theory | `second_turn` (max effort: `results/BBMAX_followthrough.md`) |
| Thinking effort; reasoning summaries; system prompts | `effort`, `reasoning_fav`, `sysprompts2` (and `results/REASONING_NOTES.md`, `results/SYSPROMPT_CROSS.md`) |
| Other philosophical debates | `realism` |
| Other models | `opus_personas`, `astra_personas`, `results/OTHER_MODELS.md` |

## Exporting the post to LessWrong

`uv run python scripts/export_lw.py` writes `post/lesswrong_post.lw.md`, the paste-ready version of the draft: no title line or byline (LessWrong has fields for those), no figure markers, no caption paragraphs, and bare dollar signs escaped so LessWrong's markdown editor does not read them as LaTeX. It refuses to run while the draft still contains a to-do, a review comment or a placeholder. The export's image links point at the exact commit the figures were pushed in (not at `main`): GitHub's raw CDN caches `main` URLs for five minutes and LessWrong re-hosts whatever it fetches, so a `main` link pasted right after a push can freeze a stale image. Commit and push the figures before exporting; the script checks both.

Figure captions are written once, as the *italic* line inside each `<!-- figure:key -->` block of the draft. `dtcues/figures.py` reads them from there and draws them into the images (LessWrong cannot style a caption paragraph), so after editing a caption, regenerate the figure with `uv run python -m dtcues.figures <key>` and re-export. The preview server and the export both hide the caption paragraphs, exactly as LessWrong will show the post.
